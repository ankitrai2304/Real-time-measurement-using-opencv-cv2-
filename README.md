Object Measurement Tool
A web application that uses computer vision to measure real-world object dimensions from photos. Upload an image with a reference object (like a credit card), and the system calculates the dimensions of other objects in the photo. Built with OpenCV for image processing and Streamlit for the user interface.
Key Features:

Automatic object detection
~ Simple calibration using everyday reference items
~ Accurate width, height, and area measurements
~ Interactive object selection
~ Visual measurement display
